        <h3 class="desktop_header">About me.</h3>
        <article>
          I’m Sara, Art Enthusiast and a future Blockchain Developer, currently studying <br class="pres_desktop">
          Blockchain Development at Medieinstitutet.<br class="pres_desktop">
          As an artist and painter, I am particularly drawn to the intersection of <br class="pres_desktop">
          blockchain technology and art. My previous experience in web development <br class="pres_desktop">
          and graphic design has allowed me to develop a keen eye for detail and a <br class="pres_desktop">
          strong understanding of user experience design principles. I believe that <br class="pres_desktop">
          these skills will be beneficial in the development of user-friendly and <br class="pres_desktop">
          visually appealing blockchain applications.<br class="pres_desktop"><br>
          Before I started studying Blockchain development, I was working a few years <br class="pres_desktop">
          as a Service Manager at campsites, Site Manager at a gym chain and Staffing <br class="pres_desktop">
          Manager at a cleaning company. During these experiences, I have grown both<br class="pres_desktop">
          as a leader and as a team player. I have a strong sense of responsibility <br class="pres_desktop">
          for my work, while my coworkers are also able to place high amount of trust <br class="pres_desktop">
          in my ability. I have also gained high tolerance towards stressful situations <br class="pres_desktop">
          and the ability to deliver under pressure. I work well independently and I <br class="pres_desktop">
          tend to be proactive when the situation demands so. <br class="pres_desktop"><br>
        During 2020-2022, I studied art, deep diving into the aspects of my own artistry <br class="pres_desktop">
        as a painter. Living in Spain for one year during this time, I had a quality time <br class="pres_desktop">
        to reflect on the work processes around painting. Over the past few years, I have <br class="pres_desktop">
        come to realize that I thrive when I get to work with something practical and <br class="pres_desktop">
        creative. I am highly capable of performing the administrative work but it is <br class="pres_desktop">
        the sense of creativity that I enjoy the most with any task. In my spare time I <br class="pres_desktop">
        find an outlet for this creativity through my painting, drawing, music, as well as <br class="pres_desktop">
        cooking and baking. Other interests are exercise, nature and hiking.
