        <h3 class="desktop_header">About me.</h3>
        <article>I'm Sara, art enthusiast and future Blockchain Developer, seeking an opportunity<br class="pres_desktop"> 
          to gain valuable experience in the fields of frontend/backend development<br class="pres_desktop">
          and Blockchain Technology. Currently, I am studying Blockchain Development <br class="pres_desktop">
          at Medieinstitutet and have completed several courses to enhance my <br class="pres_desktop">
          knowledge and skills in HTML/CSS, Javascript, React, Agile methods, Solidity <br class="pres_desktop">
          and Blockchain within business and law. Additionally, I am currently familiarizing <br class="pres_desktop">
          myself more with the concepts of Smart Contracts and NodeJS before starting <br class="pres_desktop">
          my internship in October.<br class="pres_desktop">
          In my previous professional roles I worked as a manager with a team of staff, <br class="pres_desktop">
          but I realized that my true interests lie in development and my own artistry. <br class="pres_desktop">
          This change in direction has allowed me to pursue my passion and further develop   <br class="pres_desktop">
          my skills. My background in web development and graphic design has given me a  <br class="pres_desktop">
          keen eye for detail and a strong understanding of user experience design principles.<br class="pres_desktop">
